                        <h3>display</h3>
                        <p>This defines a flex container; inline or block depending on the given value. It enables a flex context for all its direct children.</p>

                        <img src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/flex-direction.svg" alt="">
                        <p>This establishes the main-axis, thus defining the direction flex items are placed in the flex container. Flexbox is (aside from optional wrapping) a single-direction layout concept. Think of flex items as primarily laying out either
                            in horizontal rows or vertical columns.</p>

                    <div class="flexBox__mainBox--purple">
                        <h3>flex-flow</h3>
                        <p>This is a shorthand for the flex-direction and flex-wrap properties, which together define the flex container’s main and cross axes. The default value is row nowrap.</p>

                        <img src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/justify-content.svg" alt="">
                        <p>This defines the alignment along the main axis. It helps distribute extra free space leftover when either all the flex items on a line are inflexible, or are flexible but have reached their maximum size. It also exerts some control
                            over the alignment of items when they overflow the line.</p>

                                <p>left: items are packed toward left edge of the container, unless that doesn’t make sense with the flex-direction, then it behaves like start.</p>

                            <li>
                                <p>space-between: items are evenly distributed in the line; first item is on the start line, last item on the end line</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>space-around: items are evenly distributed in the line with equal space around them. Note that visually the spaces aren’t equal, since all the items have equal space on both sides. The first item will have one unit of space
                                    against the container edge, but two units of space between the next item because that next item has its own spacing that applies.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>space-evenly: items are distributed so that the spacing between any two items (and the space to the edges) is equal.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Note that that browser support for these values is nuanced. For example, space-between never got support from some versions of Edge, and start/end/left/right aren’t in Chrome yet. MDN <a href="">has detailed charts</a>. The safest
                            values are flex-start, flex-end, and center.</p>
                        <p>There are also two additional keywords you can pair with these values: safe and unsafe. Using safe ensures that however you do this type of positioning, you can’t push an element such that it renders off-screen (e.g. off the top)
                            in such a way the content can’t be scrolled too (called “data loss”).</p>

                        <img src="	https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/align-items.svg" alt="">
                        <p>This defines the default behavior for how flex items are laid out along the cross axis on the current line. Think of it as the justify-content version for the cross-axis (perpendicular to the main-axis).</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>stretch (default): stretch to fill the container (still respect min-width/max-width)</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>flex-start / start / self-start: items are placed at the start of the cross axis. The difference between these is subtle, and is about respecting the flex-direction rules or the writing-mode rules.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>flex-end / end / self-end: items are placed at the end of the cross axis. The difference again is subtle and is about respecting flex-direction rules vs. writing-mode rules.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>center: items are centered in the cross-axis</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>baseline: items are aligned such as their baselines align</p>
                            </li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>The safe and unsafe modifier keywords can be used in conjunction with all the rest of these keywords (although note browser support), and deal with helping you prevent aligning elements such that the content becomes inaccessible.</p>

                        <img src="	https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/align-content.svg" alt="">
                        <p>This aligns a flex container’s lines within when there is extra space in the cross-axis, similar to how justify-content aligns individual items within the main-axis.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>normal (default): items are packed in their default position as if no value was set.</p>

                        <p>The gap property explicitly controls the space between flex items. It applies that spacing only between items not on the outer edges.</p>
                        <p>The behavior could be thought of as a minimum gutter, as if the gutter is bigger somehow (because of something like justify-content: space-between;) then the gap will only take effect if that space would end up smaller.</p>
                        <p>It is not exclusively for flexbox, gap works in grid and multi-column layout as well.</p>

                        <p>By default, flex items are laid out in the source order. However, the order property controls the order in which they appear in the flex container.</p>
                        <p>Items with the same order revert to source order.</p>

                        <p>This defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary. It accepts a unitless value that serves as a proportion. It dictates what amount of the available space inside the flex container the item should take up.</p>
                        <p>If all items have flex-grow set to 1, the remaining space in the container will be distributed equally to all children. If one of the children has a value of 2, that child would take up twice as much of the space either one of
                            the others (or it will try, at least).</p>

                        <h3>flex-shrink</h3>
                        <p>This defines the ability for a flex item to shrink if necessary.</p>
                        <p>Negative numbers are invalid.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="flexBox__mainBox--orange">
                        <h3>flex-basis</h3>
                        <p>This defines the default size of an element before the remaining space is distributed. It can be a length (e.g. 20%, 5rem, etc.) or a keyword. The auto keyword means “look at my width or height property” (which was temporarily
                            done by the main-size keyword until deprecated). The content keyword means “size it based on the item’s content” – this keyword isn’t well supported yet, so it’s hard to test and harder to know what its brethren max-content,
                            min-content, and fit-content do.</p>
                        <p>If set to 0, the extra space around content isn’t factored in. If set to auto, the extra space is distributed based on its flex-grow value. See this graphic.</p>

                    <div class="flexBox__mainBox--orange">
                        <h3>flex</h3>
                        <p>This is the shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis combined. The second and third parameters (flex-shrink and flex-basis) are optional. The default is 0 1 auto, but if you set it with a single number value, like flex:
                            5;, that changes the flex-basis to 0%, so it’s like setting flex-grow: 5; flex-shrink: 1; flex-basis: 0%;.</p>
                        <p>It is recommended that you use this shorthand property rather than set the individual properties. The shorthand sets the other values intelligently.</p>

                        <h3>align-self</h3>
                        <img src="https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/align-self.svg" alt="">
                        <p>This allows the default alignment (or the one specified by align-items) to be overridden for individual flex items.</p>
                        <p>Please see the align-items explanation to understand the available values.</p>
                        <p>Note that float, clear and vertical-align have no effect on a flex item.</p>
